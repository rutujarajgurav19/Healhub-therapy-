          When we hear the word trauma, we think of wars, natural disasters, and assault. Trauma also involves subtle but impactful incidents such as childhood experiences or abusive relationships. Trauma becomes distressing when the response to these events affects your mental and neurobiological functioning.

        <p>
          Seeking counselling for trauma helps process experiences, manage symptoms, and develop healthy coping strategies for future stressful events.
